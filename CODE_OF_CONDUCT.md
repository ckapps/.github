# Code of conduct

:pencil2: This document is still drafting :pencil2:

The internet can be a great place, because it connects people from all around the world, making you a global citizen. In order to ensure that everyone feels comfortable and can make themselves a home in the world, we encourage everyone to follow these guidelines.

- **:hugs: Be nice** Noone likes to be yelled at. If you feel the urge, maybe it is time to take a break. Go for a walk, grap a cup of coffee or tea or do some workout. This helps clearing your mind and take a step back.
- **:rainbow_flag: Be tolerant** Appreciate the diversity of life. Racism, sexism, transphobia, ... has no place in this world.
- **:sos: Look out for each other** If you experience any abuse or alike, be sure to let us know. This is also true, if you are not affected by it first hand, but happen to notice it.
